      <description>Previously I made a game using Unity3D with my friends where we need to handle localization sent by the server. while my friends focus on working with the game design, I deal with the localization. I show up with some ideas but I found all of them is not suitable, because the game has many texts inside to be found one by one. We need to store the text into a JSON file, we can write it again one by one into the JSON file, but it will take a while.</description>

      <description>Recently I learn a book about “Designing the User Experience of Game Development Tools”, the book is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. As a tools programmer, this is a book that I must read, to make my tools better.
What is User Experience?
There are many definitions of user experience. The popular one is from Elizabeth Sanders,
 Tools need to be, &amp;ldquo;Useful, Usable and Desireable&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Intro When you working on your game, you also want to debug, know the process of your game, take a look at the log you create for that game. It’s easy to take a look at the log in the game engine or framework, but how if I wanna look the log from the game when it already becomes executable files e.g .exe, .apk etc.
In Android, you can open a terminal and show the log cat but the experience is painful since it shows all the log from your android device too, or you can open android studio and take a look at the log cat there, but sometimes we do not need all the log from our device.</description>
