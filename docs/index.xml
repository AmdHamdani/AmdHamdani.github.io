      <description>Recently I learn a book about &amp;ldquo;Designing the User Experience of Game Development Tools&amp;rdquo;, the book is pretty straight forward and easy to understand. As a tools programmer this is a book that I must read, in order to make my tools better.
What is User Experience?
There are many definition about user experience, but from the I read. The populer one is from Elizabeth Sanders,
 Tools need to be, &amp;ldquo;Useful, Usable and Desireable&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Intro When you working on your game, you mostly also want to debug, know the process of your game, take a look at the log you create for that game. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to take a look at the log in the game engine or framework, but how if I wanna look the log from the game when it&amp;rsquo;s already became executable files e.g .exe, .apk etc.
In Android you can open terminal and show the log cat but the experience is painfull since it show all the log from your android device too, or you can open android studio and take a look at the log cat there, but sometimes we does not need all the log from our device.</description>
