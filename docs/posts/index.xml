      <description>Recently, I start using Unreal Engine to develop games. I did not have proper C++ or Unreal Engine knowledge, I usually use Unity and C#. While learning and using it, I stumbled across some problems. So I decide to make some notes that I can use and share with others.
 Print Enum Into FString StaticEnum&amp;lt;ENUM_TYPE&amp;gt;()-&amp;gt;GetValueAsString(ENUM_VALUE) Format FText FText format = &amp;#34;Item Name: {ItemName}&amp;#34; const FText formattedText = FText::FormatNamed(FTextFormat(format), TEXT(&amp;#34;ItemName&amp;#34;), itemName); Loop UDataTable itemDT-&amp;gt;ForeachRow&amp;lt;FItemInfo&amp;gt;(&amp;#34;FindItem&amp;#34;, [&amp;amp;](const FName&amp;amp; key, const FItemInfo&amp;amp; item) {  // Do something here }); Find a Row in UDataTable FItemInfo* itemInfo = itemDT-&amp;gt;FindRow&amp;lt;FItemInfo&amp;gt;(ROW_NAME, &amp;#34;FindItem&amp;#34;); Create UObject Instance UTextBlock* text = NewObject&amp;lt;UTextBlock&amp;gt;(btn, FName(&amp;#34;text&amp;#34;)); Hide Field on Certain Condition UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, meta=(Condition=&amp;#34;YOUR_CONDITION&amp;#34;, EditConditionHides)) float speed; Create Min Max Slider for Field UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, meta = (ClampMin = &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;, ClampMax = &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;)) int32 totalSpawned;  The code above is not tested and is used for reference only.</description>

      <title>Unity Automatic Localization System</title>

      <description>Previously I made a game using Unity3D with my friends where we need to handle localization sent by the server. while my friends focus on working with the game design, I deal with the localization. I show up with some ideas but I found all of them is not suitable, because the game has many texts inside to be found one by one. We need to store the text into a JSON file, we can write it again one by one into the JSON file, but it will take a while.</description>

      <description>I believe all of us have a goal to achieve in life. but sometimes it just feels hard to achieve and we do not know where we should start.
I want to develop and publish my own games but as time pass, I feel pretty lazy, tired especially after work. I usually work on my games in my free times.
Last year, my senior told me about Smart Framework, I read about it but I failed to really understand it.</description>

      <description>Recently I learn a book about “Designing the User Experience of Game Development Tools”, the book is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. As a tools programmer, this is a book that I must read, to make my tools better.
What is User Experience?
There are many definitions of user experience. The popular one is from Elizabeth Sanders,
 Tools need to be, &amp;ldquo;Useful, Usable and Desireable&amp;rdquo;

      <title>Create in Game Console for Unity</title>

      <description>Intro When you working on your game, you also want to debug, know the process of your game, take a look at the log you create for that game. It’s easy to take a look at the log in the game engine or framework, but how if I wanna look the log from the game when it already becomes executable files e.g .exe, .apk etc.
In Android, you can open a terminal and show the log cat but the experience is painful since it shows all the log from your android device too, or you can open android studio and take a look at the log cat there, but sometimes we do not need all the log from our device.</description>
