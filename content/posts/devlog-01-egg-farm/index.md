Welcome to the first update for Egg Farm, the game title may change in the future.

Egg Farm is a relaxing mini farming game, where you can just sit and interact with everything inside the game, plant crops, and ranch animals, and design your own farm.

Since this is a mini-game there will not be many features existing, although I still add more features that seem fun.

There is still more work that needs to be done to finish this game.

The available features are planting, mill, and bee farm.

## Planting

Available crops are wheat and flower, you just need to plant the seed and water it. The crops gonna grow on their own after a certain time. There is no day-night cycle in this game so you just need to wait for a while.
